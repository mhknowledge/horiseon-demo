# Horiseon Webpage Demo

This webpage was designed to meet the accessiblity requirements of end-users with different abilities, as well as disablities that may neccesitate assistive technologies.  With the incorporation of different kinds of assitive technologies we are aiming for a site that ranks higher on various search engines utilized on the web.

During this project we became familiar with semantic HTML elements, there was an emphasis on the importance of structure with regards to the elements as well.  We became aware of how to incorporate alt attributes into our css.  Heading attributes are designed to fall in sequential order.  And lastly, throughout this project we became familiar with creating github repositories, pages, and commands such as git add, git commit, and git push.
